## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your installation, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated:**
  - Regularly update all dependencies and third-party libraries to the latest versions.
  
- **Use Strong API Keys:**
  - Ensure your Cohere API key is stored securely and is not hardcoded in your codebase. Use environment variables or configuration files with restricted access.

  - Limit access to the server or system running the AI Blog Article Generator to trusted users only.

- **Regular Audits:**
  - Periodically audit the security of your installation, including checking for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
